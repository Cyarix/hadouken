Creating plugins
================

Hadouken was built with plugins in mind, and a lot of the core functionality in Hadouken is distributed as plugins. The API is easy to work with, and the framework does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

To create plugins you will need knowledge of C#, HTML, and JavaScript. Visual Studio 2012/2013 is also required.

Project structure
-----------------

Create a new class library in Visual Studio, giving it a name of your choice. For this tutorial, I'll name the project *Tutorial.TestPlugin*.
