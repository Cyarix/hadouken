Hadouken documentation
======================

Overview
--------

Hadouken is a cross-platform headless BitTorrent client. It runs as a Linux
daemon/Windows Service and provides a JSONRPC API over HTTP to control it. In
addition to running headless, Hadouken also has a powerful extension system
that gives developers freedom to extend it in various ways.
