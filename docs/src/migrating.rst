Migrating from v4
=================

Overview
--------

This will guide you through migrating your torrents from a previous version of
Hadouken.

.. note:: Plugin settings cannot be migrated at this point.


Moving torrents
---------------

Make sure you have started Hadouken v5 at least once, then copy the files
(both *.torrent* and *.resume*) from :file:`C:/ProgramData/Hadouken/Torrents`
to :file:`C:/ProgramData/Hadouken/state/torrents`.

Restart the Hadouken service and your torrents should be available.
