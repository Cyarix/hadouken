Installing Hadouken on Windows
==============================

Overview
--------

This will guide you through the installation of Hadouken on Windows.

Hadouken runs as a native Windows Service and is only accessible via the
HTTP API it provides. No client application is bundled with the Hadouken
installer.


Getting the installer
---------------------

We provide MSI (Windows Installer) files for Hadouken which supports both
attended and unattended installs. The latest installer can be downloaded from
`the build server <https://builds.nullreferenceexception.se/>`_.


Installing
----------

Follow the installation procedure and configure the basic settings as you wish.

It is recommended to enable HTTP authentication since anonymous access will let
anyone control your Hadouken instance.
