For developers
==============

Hadouken has both a JSONRPC service and a JavaScript API. You can use the
JSONRPC service to create third-party software that integrates with Hadouken
in various ways - this is what the official remote client does.

The JavaScript API is used for extending Hadouken directly. You have access to
all parts of Hadouken and can tailor it to your needs.
