==========================

Hadouken is a BitTorrent client written in C# and designed to run as a Windows Service. It has plugin support and is managed completely through a web UI.

Setting up a local environment
------------------------------
Clone the repository, run tools/SetupLocalEnvironment.bat, open the solution. Press play :)

The batch file copies a CommonAssemblyInfo.cs in place, builds both Debug and Release configurations, then creates directory junctions for the WebUI.
