# Overview

Hadouken is a modern, open source, cross-platform BitTorrent client written in C++11. It has native plugin support and comes bundled with a bunch of useful plugins.

It runs as a Linux daemon/Windows Service and can be controlled with the bundled HTTP API plugin which provides a JSONRPC service that should support everything needed for a remote client implementation.

## Getting started

Currently, building from source is the only way of getting binaries. To build Hadouken you will need Boost (>= 1.57), OpenSSL (>= 1.0.2) and Rasterbar-libtorrent (>= 1.0.3).

## For developers
