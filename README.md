Hadouken is a modern, open source, cross-platform BitTorrent client written in
C++14. It is built on Boost and Rasterbar-libtorrent, and designed to run
headless either as a Linux daemon or Windows Service.

## Getting started

To get started, head over to [the releases](https://github.com/hadouken/hadouken/releases)
and download a binary for your platform. If none exists, you might need to
build one yourself.

Once you have Hadouken running, you can head over to
[the remote client](http://remote.hdkn.net) to start managing your instance.

Please refer to [the documentation](http://docs.hdkn.net) for more information
on how to configure and run Hadouken on your platform.
